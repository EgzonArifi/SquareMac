# SquareMac
macOS Application. 

A string S is called a square if there is some string T such that S = T + T. For example, 

the strings "aabaab" and "xxxx" are squares, but "a", "aabb" and "aabbaa" are not. 

You are given a String s. You want to change s into a square. You may do the following operations:

 Insert a new character anywhere into the string (including its beginning and end).

 Remove a single character.

 Replace a single character by another character.

Please compute and return the smallest number of operations needed to change the given s into a square.

Note that this is always possible: for example, you can remove all characters (one at a time).
